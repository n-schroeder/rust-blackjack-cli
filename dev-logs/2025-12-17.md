## Agenda

- [x] set up hand module
- [x] write Hand struct and constructor
- [x] write add_card() method
- [] write calculate_total() method
- [] tackle ace handling

## Achievements

### Successfully Formulated a Test for deal_card()

- This test effectively asserted that my entire program I have written up until now works
- I first created `h: Hand`, then created `c:card`, and pushed `c` into `h`
- I then affirmed that `h.cards` had a length of 1
- Finally, I affirmed that the `Card` added to `h` was equivalent to `c`
