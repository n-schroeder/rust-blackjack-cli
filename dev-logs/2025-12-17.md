## Agenda

- [x] set up hand module
- [x] write Hand struct and constructor
- [x] write add_card() method
- [x] write calculate_total() method
- [x] tackle ace handling

## Achievements

### Formulated a Test for deal_card()

- This test effectively asserted that my entire program I have written up until now works
- I first created `h: Hand`, then created `c:card`, and pushed `c` into `h`
- I then affirmed that `h.cards` had a length of 1
- Finally, I affirmed that the `Card` added to `h` was equivalent to `c`

### Formulated a Test for Hand Value Calculation

- This test actually caught a problem within my code
- I created this function to test 3 different scenarios:

    1. Hand without need for bust adjustment
    2. Hand with 1 ace in need of adjustment
    3. Hand with 2 aces in need of adjustment

- This test failed when it came to the third scenario; the value I expected, 18, was not equivalent to the value calculated by the program, 28
- This led me to fix the program, and it is now functional

### Created and Refactored is_blackjack()

- I created a method to return a boolean for whether or not the hand was a blackjack
- I initially used a nested loop to first check if the Hand length was 2, then check if value == 21
- I refactored to a singular statement: `self.cards.len() == 2 && self.value() == 21`
- Tests still pass

## Struggles

### Adjust for Bust with Multipe Aces

- While attempting to form ace handling logic, I used an `if` statement to subtract 10 from `total_value` and 1 from `ace_count`
- When I created my test function, it caught that `total_value` did not adjust when more than one ace was present
- To fix this, I used a `while` loop to adjust until either `total_value` <= 21 or `ace_count` == 0
