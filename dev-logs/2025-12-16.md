# Dev Log: 2025-12-16

## Agenda

- [x] Create Deck::shuffle() method
- [x] Create deck::deal_card() method
- [ ] Record another dev log video
- [ ] Finalize deck module and merge branches

## Achievements

### Implemented Shuffling

- Used `rand` crate and Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle deck in-place
- Created test function and verified using cargo test -- --nocapture

### Used Comments Generously

- I used plenty of comments to help communicate my methodology and what my code does
- Not only makes my program clearer, but also helps me retrace my steps and create my dev log video

## Struggles

### Navigating Derive Macros

- I was unaware of how Attributes work. I simply put `#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]` as a header on the top of my card and deck modules. As a result, my test would not compile
- I now know that the Debug macro is needed to print `{:?}`. I also know that I must add the derive macros to each and every struct or enum that needs them

### Deal Card Methodology

- Wanted to use `remove(0)` like I did in my java blackjack game
- Instead, to improve efficiency, I decided to use `pop()`
- Using `pop()` forced me to use return type `Option<Card>`
- When writing the test function and using `assert_eq!`, I could not compare, as types differed
- I dealt with this easily after finding out about `unwrap()`
