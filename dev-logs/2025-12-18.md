# Dev Log: 2025-12-18

## Agenda

- [] Modify string format for `Card` and `Hand`
- [] Create playloop to correctly handle game exit
- [] Refactor hand module if needed
- [] Create functional betting loop

## Struggles

### Betting Loop Flow

- To start, I could not figure out how to read user input.
- After reading up on rust's method, I read user input and attempted to filter out bad bets
- I initially tried to put that logic inside the `match` function, which I learned was a bad idea.
- The `match` function is not like when I handled bad bets in Java using `try`. Java lets you put flow control logic like `if` statements inside. When tried to do the same with `match`, my code kept redlining. I learned that match does not immediately return a parsed int inside the function, which sounds obvious.
- I handles the errors by separating my bet filter logic and my bet parsing logic. I first return the result of the user input (or `continue` the loop if it is not a number), then check to see if that result is valid in terms of the game rules

### Reading User Input in Rust

- Originally, after I fixed the parsing logic, my program did not like the user inputs no matter what the input was.
- I learned that `read_line()` does not replace whichever String it is outputting to, but rather appends it.
- With this in mind, I flushed the String var and everything worked perfect.
