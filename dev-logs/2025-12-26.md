# Dev Log: 2025-12-26

## Agenda

- [x] Build `main.rs` alongside `game.rs`
- [x] Create `user-interface.rs`
- [x] Complete betting loop
- [ ] Practice clear, professional documentation

## Achievements

### UI Module

- I have created a UI module, `user_interface.rs` that allows me to have as little code in `main.rs` as possible. I do this so that I can maintain a modular program. If I were to want to add a split feature, it would be very hard to make that if everything was in `main.rs`.
- In the UI module I handle all displays to the user, along with instances of retrieving and processing information.

### Update `main` function in real time

- As I build, I have been treating `main` as its own thing to be tackled. Instead, I am now calling functions and methods I create as I create them in order to track progress and validate work more easily.

## Struggles

### Managing nested loops in `main`

- As I have been trying to refactor my program, I wanted to stray from confusing, nested loops. However, I now realize that sometimes, nested loops are inevitable
- In order to properly simulate the functions of a game session and a round, I must create two different loops.
